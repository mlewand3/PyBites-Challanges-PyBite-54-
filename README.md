Script for storaging clipboard content

Task description:

The idea here is to capture whatever the user copies to the clipboard (think CTRL C) and "store" it in some way such that the user can see the history of everything they've copied for later reference.

    A great starting point would be to look at the pyperclip module for Python.

    This can be as simple or as complex as you like. If all you manage to do is get the basics down, that's fine!

    Consider creating a GUI!

    How will you store text copied to the clipboard? Persistent storage or will the history be wiped every time the script is stopped and started?

    How far back will your historical data go?
